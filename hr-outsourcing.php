    <h2>Introduction to HR Outsourcing</h2>
    <p>Outsourcing HR can reduce your administration time and allow you to focus on growing your business. Outsourcing means obtaining work that was done by employees previously inside the company from sources outside the company. Leading companies worldwide are taking the most strategic approach to managing human resources.</p>
    <p>HR outsourcing refers to the process by which a company uses the HR outsourcing services of a third person to save their HR functions. A company can outsource some or all functions from single or combinations of HR service providers located in many destinations like India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
